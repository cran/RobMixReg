\title{flexmix_2: Multiple runs of MLE based mixture regression to stabilize the output.}
\usage{
flexmix_2(formula, data1, k, mprior)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A symbolic description of the model to be fit.}

\item{data1}{A data frame containing the predictor and response variables, where the last column is the response varible.}

\item{k}{Number of mixture components.}

\item{mprior}{A numeric number in (0,1) that specifies the minimum proportion of samples in each mixing components.}
}
\value{
A S4 object of flexmix class. xxx
}
\description{
Mixture regression based on MLE could be unstable when assuming unequal variance. Multiple runs of flexmix is performed to stabilize the results.
